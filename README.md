# Calculator App

<h2 align='center'> ABOUT </h2>
This is a calculator I created in Python.

Once initialised, the user is given a menu of 3 choices:
  - Enter 2 numbers and an operator to perform a calculation.
  - Read equations from a text file.
  - Exit.

If the user chooses choice 1 they can input their calculation and it will be stored to a text file and printed.

If the user chooses choice 2 they are told to input the name of the text file to read the equations from - if the file is found, the equations will print.

If the user chooses choice 3 they will exit the program.

<h2 align='center'> HOW TO USE </h2>
To use this program, fork this repo to your local machine and run the calculator.py file.
